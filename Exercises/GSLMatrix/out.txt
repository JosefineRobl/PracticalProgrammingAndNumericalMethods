=============== Exercise A ===============
--------------- Subexercise I ---------------
Using GSL Householder sovler for liniar systems yields
x =
[  -1.137902
   -2.833031
    0.851459 ]
--------------- Subexercise II ---------------
Now for checking if A*x (for calculated x) is equal to the given b, we now calculate c = A*x, and we will compare b and c.
c =
[   6.230000
    5.370000
    2.290000 ]
b =
[   6.230000
    5.370000
    2.290000 ]
c is equal to b with a tolerance of 0.001.

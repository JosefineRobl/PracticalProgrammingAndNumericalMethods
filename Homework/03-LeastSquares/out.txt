=============== GENERAL INFO ===============
For the answer to exercise A, the fit and the half-life can be found later in this file, alongside the reference value half-life from Wikipedia, and the plot of this is seen in leastSquarePlot.png. Also later in this file, the covariance matrix can be found (exercise B), and on the png-file, the fit is plottet both with and without its uncertainties (exercise C).

=============== RESULTS ===============
The polynomial for the fit is given by:
	4.95867*x^0)-0.171379*x^1)and thus the value of c1 is -0.171379.
The estimation of the value for the half-life of the THX, which is based upon a least square fit, is 4.04452 days.
 Resolving to Wikipedia for the correct value, one gets 3.6319 days. This is slightly in agreement with one another.

Furthermore one could note that the covariance matrix for the calculation is
    [	0.0009	-9e-05
	-9e-05	1e-05	]
